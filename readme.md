FarmWare aims to eliminate the information asymmetry between the farmers and the warehouses, primarily through setting up a room for farmers and warehouses separately. Individual portals will be allocated to both the parties, namely Farmer’s Portal and Warehouse’s Portal. It uses the concept of IoT, as it collects the direct information from the warehouse about the space availability, humidity and temperature and also information about the farmland. So, the farmers can get the real time data from sensors. The main aim of our app is to build a strong and effective communication between farmers and Warehouses and reduce the food wastage.
